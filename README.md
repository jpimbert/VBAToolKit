VBAToolKit
==========

VBAToolkit is an open-source framework aiming to ease the development of quality VBA code.  
It is designed to be used as a tool on the developer's machine to create and manage a VBA project (only Excel at the moment).  
  
Its features include :   
  
**Management of configurations**  
Currently, its main feature is to ease the management of different configurations of a VBA project. Mainly a configuration for delivery to the end user, and a configuration for development purpose. The second one contains test modules not included in the first one.

**Allowing versioning**  
VBA modules are stored separately in text files, consistent versioning is made possible. 
Though, VBATookit does not integrate any versioning system ; using a third party software such as Git in the project directory is the way.

**Team collaborative development**
Excel files can be regenerated from the text source code under version management. This facilitates the merge operations and thus the team collaborative development.

**Facilitating Test Driven Development**  
VBAToolkit integrates the open-source unit-testing VBAUnit framework to encourage and facilitate Test Driven Development, an healthy development method.

**Convenient interface**  
A toolbar in Excel and several automatic functions provide easy access to these features.
